## General Information
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths.
- A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis


<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Basic CNN model had issues of overfitting
- Data augmentation and using drop out layers helped to remove overfitting
- Data set has calss imbalance issue , removing class imbalance issue using augmentation technique helped along with batch normalization helped in improving model accuracy
